# SoundRecognitionTCN
Lightweight End2End Sound Recognition Pipeline using Temporal Convolutional Networks (CNN-TCN architecture) and Data Augmentation by SpecAugment. The implementation features the UrbanSound8K dataset, available here: https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html

You can also directly try the jupyter notebook in Google Colab without needing an own GPU : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wflMtZzj3wXiXYrH7Y3vR1m4fdf5TJyD

Disclaimer: This was part of a small university project of mine last summer. It's just been a 2 hrs/week project where the initial goal was to exercise reading papers in the domain of audio engineering and writing your own one (max. 4 pages) based on that. Since I'm loving AI, want to spread the glorious TCN among all those foolish LSTM users (:P :P) and stumbled upon SpecAugment, I couldn't resist overshooting the target a bit by doing AI stuff and implementing that ^^

It's not perfect and you should not see this as "real" research paper, but maybe somebody is interested in the code and architecture nevertheless, so I'm uploading this here. ;)
