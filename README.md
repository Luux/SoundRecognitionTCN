# SoundRecognitionTCN
Lightweight End2End Sound Recognition Pipeline using Temporal Convolutional Networks and SpecAugment

This was part of a small university project of mine last summer. It's just been a 2 hrs/week project where the initial goal was to exercise reading papers in the domain of audio engineering and writing your own one (max. 4 pages) based on that. Since I'm loving AI, want to spread the glorious TCN among all those foolish LSTM users and stumbled upon SpecAugment, I couldn't resist overshooting the target a bit by making AI stuff and implementing that :P

It's not perfect and you should not see this as a "real" research paper, but maybe somebody is still interested in the code and architecture, so I'm uploading this here. ;)

You can also directly try the jupyter notebook in Google Colab without needing a GPU yourself: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wflMtZzj3wXiXYrH7Y3vR1m4fdf5TJyD
